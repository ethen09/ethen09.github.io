          <strong>Personal Background:</strong>I was born in Massachusetts, came

          come to enjoy the southern culture.

          <strong>Professional Background:</strong>I have had many jobs since I
          was 15. I was working in many very different places, from fast food to
          customer service. Now I work with a non profit organization

          <strong>Subject Background:</strong>When I was very young my fathers
          friend was in the military doing work in cyber security and he
          introduced me to the world of computer science. I got c++ notepad and
          made a small website just about myself. Since then I haven’t done a
          lot until covid when I worked on some roblox game projects and learned
          about the language Lua, nothing much came out of it but It was fun and
          interesting.

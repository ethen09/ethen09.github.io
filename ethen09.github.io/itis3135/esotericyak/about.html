        We are a clothing store, blog and discussion board that helps users find
        ethically sourced alternatives for their favorite garments. Our blog
        offers an oppurtunity to share experiences, build community, spread
        information, create and organize. Discussion boards can be a powerful
        tool in communities like these, giving individuals a platform with those
        of similar or maybe even opposing views to support and nurture
        eachothers understanding and involvement with our brand and what we
        stand for.
